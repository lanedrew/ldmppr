# ldmppr: Estimate and Simulate from Location Dependent Marked Point Processes

A suite of tools for estimating, assessing model fit, simulating from,
and visualizing location dependent marked point processes characterized
by regularity in the pattern. You provide a reference marked point
process, a set of raster images containing location specific covariates,
and select the estimation algorithm and type of mark model. 'ldmppr'
estimates the process and mark models and allows you to check the
appropriateness of the model using a variety of diagnostic tools. Once a
satisfactory model fit is obtained, you can simulate from the model and
visualize the results. Documentation for the package 'ldmppr' is
available in the form of a vignette.
