## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version of the package we have:

* Adjusted the use of single quotes in the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file.
* Changed the use of \dontrun{} to \donttest{} in the examples for check_model_fit function and estimate_parameters_sc_parallel functions.
* Removed the ignore_unused_inputs function and replaced with an .onLoad() call in the zzz.R script.
* Bumped version number from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1.

We have not included a reference describing the methods in this package as the reference is not yet published. We will include this reference in the next version of the package.
