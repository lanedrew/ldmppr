## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version of the package we have:

* Removed the duplicate R script for estimate_parameters_sc_parallel that was resulting in double documentation with an incorrect \dontrun{} environment.
* Bumped version number from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3.

We have not included a reference describing the methods in this package as the reference is not yet published. We will include this reference in the next version of the package.
