Description: A suit of tools for estimating, assessing model fit, simulating from, and visualizing location dependent marked point processes with regularity in the pattern. You provide a reference marked point process, a set of raster images containing location specific covarites, and select the estimation algorithm and type of mark model. 'ldmppr` estimates the process and mark models and allows you to check the appropriateness of the model using a variety of diagnostic tools. Once a satisfactory model fit is achieved, you can simulate from the model and visualize the results.
